**under construction, do not attempt to use.**

**A CI tool that alerts teams when flaky tests are slowing down development**

---

get-flakes notifies you when unreliable tests are hurting your team's productivity so you can prioritise a fix.

Excessive test retrying slows delivery, wastes resources, and hides real bugs.

## Quickstart

Ensure you have Python 3 setup before you start

Install the Python package

```none
pip install get-flakes
```


```log
get-flakes report --days=9

‚úì 0 testcases logged both passing and failing statuses on a single commit.
```

| Commit | Checks | Runs |
|-|-|-|

|  Another commit merged to main| pytest (ubuntu-latest, 3.6)| √ó‚úì√ó‚úì |
